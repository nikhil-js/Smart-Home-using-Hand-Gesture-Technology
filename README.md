## About
- This project is about controlling smart home with the help of hand gesture technology. 
- People with disability or speech disabilities face problem in controlling their smart homes. 
- This project remove the barrier and give an edge to people with diasability to control their smart home.

## Description
- In this project we have used Google MediaPipe library to detect hand mesh.
- Arduino architecture is also used to implement the smart home automation demo.

## Libraries Used
- Pyfirmata
- Pandas
- Google Mediapipe

## Future Use
- This project can be used to develop a smart home automation system for people with difficulties.
- In place of Arduino we can use Wi-fi modules to connect Smart Appliances with our project to create a wireless smart home automation system.
- This system is easy to use and can be used even with a simple webcam.

## Project Updates
- We are working to create a more recognizzable image detection which help to detect hand gesture with much accuracy.
