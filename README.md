This project is about controlling smart home with the help of hand gesture technology. Camera will take user input and with the help of machine learning it will detect the gesture and using pyfirmata it will pass on the code to the arduino module. TTo connect arduino module with python script i have used standard firmata in arduino where futher used  pyfirmata to connect it with arduino.
People with disabilty or speech disabilities face problem in controlling their smart homes. This project will remove the barrier and give an edge to people with diasability to control their home like other people.
